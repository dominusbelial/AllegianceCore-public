# AllegianceCore

C# port of the Allegiance simulation data layer. Server-side only — no
rendering, no networking, no COM.

Scope decision: **headless server + bots first, no render client.**

## Build & test

```bash
export DOTNET_ROOT="$HOME/.dotnet"     # NOT /snap/bin/dotnet, which is a broken stub
export PATH="$DOTNET_ROOT:$PATH"
dotnet build
dotnet test
```

SDK 10.0.400. `dotnet --version` must print `10.0.400`; if you see
"Looks like you don't yet have a .NET SDK", your `PATH` is wrong.

```bash
dotnet run --project tools/igcdump -- /home/domingo/Development/Artwork/PCore001.igc
```

## Status

**Container frame: done and verified. Payload decoding: the fixed-size static
types are done; variable-length subtypes remain.**

All eleven fixed-size static payload structs are decoded and corpus-verified.
The remaining payload work is variable-length (part types with subtype
dispatch, treasure sets) and the map-file objects.

| | |
|---|---|
| corpus | **210 unique** `.igc` files (217 on disk; 7 are byte-identical cross-tree duplicates) |
| acceptance | **210/210 consumed exactly** — no trailing bytes, no overruns |
| wrappers | 99 static cores (`version`+`datasize`), 111 maps (`datasize`) |
| tests | 225 passing |

### The acceptance property

There is no Windows here to diff against the original writer, so the oracle is
**exact byte consumption**: for every file the record stream must land precisely
on end-of-body. A wrong field width or offset anywhere desynchronises everything
after it, so this single property catches nearly every layout error without a
reference implementation.

It was first established by `../allegiance-tools/scan_igc_corpus.py`; this
library reproduces it.

## Implemented

- `IgcObjectType` — the 24 `ObjectType` values (`src/Igc/igc.h:114-160`)
- `IgcRecord` — the 6-byte header: `int16 type`, `int32 size` (payload excludes header)
- `IgcReader` — wrapper detection + record-stream walk
- `IgcFile` — records, wrapper form, version, exactness

**Payload decoders** (`src/Allegiance.Core/Data/`), each a `readonly record
struct` with a `Decode(ReadOnlySpan<byte>)` that throws on a wrong record size:

| type | struct | size | corpus count |
|---|---|---|---|
| 22 `OT_projectileType` | `DataProjectileTypeIGC` | 88 | 9369 |
| 23 `OT_missileType` | `DataMissileTypeIGC` | 524 | 5370 |
| 24 `OT_mineType` | `DataMineTypeIGC` | 480 | 782 |
| 25 `OT_probeType` | `DataProbeTypeIGC` | 492 | 4760 |
| 26 `OT_chaffType` | `DataChaffTypeIGC` | 468 | 619 |
| 27 `OT_civilization` | `DataCivilizationIGC` | 268 | 952 |
| 29 `OT_hullType` | `DataHullTypeIGC` | 540 + 30·maxWeapons | 38927 |
| 31 `OT_stationType` | `DataStationTypeIGC` | 524 | 12659 |
| 32 `OT_development` | `DataDevelopmentIGC` | 468 | 28500 |
| 33 `OT_droneType` | `DataDroneTypeIGC` | 384 | 6503 |
| 34 `OT_constants` | `DataConstantsIGC` | 1760 | 99 (one per core) |

The five `OT_expendableType`-derived types (missile/mine/probe/chaff, plus the
shared base read into each) embed a `LauncherDef`; their full flattened
layouts were verified per-record. `DataConstantsIGC` is a flat 40 + 20×20
matrix of floats (`c_fcidMax`/`c_dmgidMax`/`c_defidMax`, all 20 or 40).

Detection walks each candidate wrapper and takes whichever lands exactly on
end-of-body, rather than guessing from the filename. A wrong wrapper
desynchronises the very first header, so this is unambiguous in practice.

### Corpus-measured corrections to the wiki table

The wiki's `allegiance-igc-file-format` page carries a ⭐ corrections section,
but further field-level discrepancies surfaced while decoding (none in the
wiki's own corrections list; all are reflected in the decoders):

1. **`DataProjectileTypeIGC.width` is at offset 80, not 78.** After
   `bDirectional` at 76 the float needs 4-byte alignment, so there are three pad
   bytes 77-79. Verified: `width`@80 is a clean float in all 9369 records and
   `ambientSound` is `-1` in every one.
2. **`DataCivilizationIGC` has a pad byte at 159** pushing `gasBaseAttributes`
   to 160-259; the trailing `lifepod`/`civilizationID`/`initialStationTypeID`
   sit at 260/262/264 (the wiki's draft said gas@159 and IDs at 259/261/263).
   Verified: every `lifepod` and `initialStationTypeID` decodes to a real
   hull/station-type ID present in the same core.

3. **The expendable types and the station type carry the same
   narrow-to-wide padding pattern.** For missile/mine/probe/chaff
   (all `DataExpendableTypeIGC`-derived, `igc.h:1947`), the fully flattened
   layouts have pads at 50-51 (after `DataObjectIGC`), 426-427 (inside the
   embedded `LauncherDef` after its `DataBuyableIGC` base), and a single pad
   before the derived tail — 463 for the tail-start float. Concretely:
   `loadTime`@52, `launcherDef.signature`@428, `hitPoints`@440, and
   `expendabletypeID`@446 are common to all four; `iconName` ends at 463.
   The tails then diverge: missile `acceleration`@464 (…`ambientSound`@520,
   two trailing pads to 524), mine `radius`@464 (…`damageType`@476, three
   trailing pads to 480), chaff `chaffStrength`@464, probe `scannerRange`@464
   (…`dtRipcord`@488). The station type (`igc.h:2649`) pads after its base to
   `signature`@364 and has a single pad before `constructionDroneTypeID`@458
   (after the byte `classID`@456). Every float in every one of these records
   is a clean finite value across the corpus; these offsets match
   `tools/verify_layout.py`, which the last batch left in the tree.
4. **`DataConstantsIGC` has no padding** — it is entirely floats
   (40 `floatConstants`, then `20×20 damageConstants`, `igc.h:21`), so the
   1760-byte struct is trivially 4-aligned throughout.

## Not implemented

Two static payload structs remain undecoded: `OT_partType` (30) and
`OT_treasureSet` (28) are variable-length — part types dispatch to seven
subtypes by equipment type, and a treasure set carries a variable number of
`TreasureData` records after its 12-byte head. The map-file objects
(ship 0, station 1, asteroid 5, warp 7, treasure 8, cluster 13) are also
undone. Decode them one `ObjectType` at a time, committing each.

Layouts are specified in the wiki page `allegiance-igc-file-format`.
⚠️ That page carries a **corpus-measured corrections** section; where it
contradicts an earlier section, the corrections win. Where the page and
`src/Igc/igc.h` disagree, `igc.h` wins (it is the actual writer).

## Facts worth keeping

- **Plaintext on disk.** The `munge` decrypt hook is wired only for the Zone
  Club download path; `ALLSRV_STANDALONE` passes NULL
  (`src/FedSrv/fsmission.cpp:164-166`). No decryptor needed.
- **Hull stride is 30**, not 29: `540 + 30 * maxWeapons`. Sizes observed are
  540/570/600/…/780, every delta exactly 30.
- **The version word is a Unix timestamp** — `PCore001.igc` carries
  `990051329` = 2001-05-17, matching
  `iStaticCoreVersion = static_cast<...>(time(0))` (`missionigc.cpp:2363`).
- **Artwork lives in two trees.** A search scoped to the code repo alone finds
  almost none of the corpus.
